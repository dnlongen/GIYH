# GIYH: 2015 SANS Holiday Hack scripts and aids

Each December, security training and certification company SANS puts together a highly anticipated hacking challenge. These challenges are a variation on Capture the Flag â€“ digital puzzles designed to test our skills (and in many cases, excuses to learn new techniques). In addition to being a fun way to compete with peers, learning new attack techniques is a great first step toward learning how to detect and defend against the same attacks.

See https://www.securityforrealpeople.com/p/gnome-in-your-home-complete-solution.html for a walk-through, and https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2015/ for the challenge itself.
